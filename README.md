# Quant_Anal

This repository contains quantitative analysis codes for data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and time-series analysis, providing flexible tools for making money. Maybe. Hopefully.

This repo is not documented at all. It is mainly for personal use, but feel free to look around.

## Future Plans

**Pattern Matching**  
Cut out windows from charts. These intervals will be *patterns*.  
Have a distance metric between these patterns.  
Distances can be: L1, L2, correlation, point-pair-wise monotonicity, point-pair-wise change, etc.  
Before distance calculation normalization or standardization can be applied.
Clusterize these patterns based on a distance.
Find the most distant patterns. These distant patterns can be rare and may suggest special information.
